# forest dieback app

A streamlit implementation of the forest dieback model proposed by [Ritchie *et al.* 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03263-2).

This application was originally coded for the "FÃªte de la Science 2022" at the Institut Sophia Agrobiotech, Sophia Antipolis, France, October 6 and 9, 2022.

The root folder contains the latest version of a multipage application, while the `mono_pages_app` folder contains an older monopage app and monopage simple and extended apps dedicated to smartphones.

The `utils` folder contains a package implementing all the required functions for simulations, and the `img` folder basic graphic things and some basic non-interactive code generated plots.
